    <h2>The Importance of Being Earnest</h2>   
    <h4>Algernon Moncrieff's Flat in Half-Moon Street, W.</h4> 
    <p>
        ALGERNON.
        How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?
        <br>
        JACK.
        Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as
        usual, I see, Algy!
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        [Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some
        slight refreshment at five o’clock. Where have you been since last
        Thursday?
        <br>
        JACK.
        [Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        What on earth do you do there?
        <br>
        JACK.
        [Pulling off his gloves_._] When one is in town one amuses oneself.
        When one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively
        boring.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        And who are the people you amuse?
        <br>
        JACK.
        [Airily_._] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?
        <br>
        JACK.
        Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        How immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By
        the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?
        <br>
        JACK.
        Eh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber
        sandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is
        coming to tea?
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.
        <br>
        JACK.
        How perfectly delightful!
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite
        approve of your being here.
        <br>
        JACK.
        May I ask why?
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly
        disgraceful. It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.
